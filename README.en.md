Codex Work Receipt summarizes turns, tool calls, Tokens, duration, and models, then turns them into playful AI work points, a job title, and a review. Receipts never include prompts, responses, source code, project paths, or file names.

Version `0.6.0` uses the cwr2 protocol to create stable privacy-safe facts for each session and calendar day. Overlapping today, last-seven-days, and this-week receipts can be deduplicated by the receiver, and oversized payloads are automatically split into reorderable multipart QR codes that rotate one at a time in the HTML so the camera never sees multiple data codes at once.

## Quickstart

Requires Node.js 20+ and local Codex session records. No clone required; choose today, the last 7 days, this week, or a specific session:

```bash
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --lang en
```

Summarize all Codex activity from today:

```bash
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --today --lang en
```

HTML and structured data are written to `./codex-work-receipt-output/` by default. The generated page can save a high-resolution PNG containing the full receipt and QR import stub. Non-interactive options such as `--latest` and `--today` remain available; see the [CLI guide](docs/cli.en.md).

## Ask Codex directly

Install the AI Work Receipt skill once:

```bash
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --install-skill --lang en
```

Then ask Codex:

> Create an AI work receipt for my latest Codex session.

Codex will choose the range and theme, run the CLI, and open the receipt. See the [Codex Skill guide](docs/codex-skill.en.md).

## Desktop to mobile

The desktop page generates one or more privacy-safe data QR codes. The companion WeChat mini program supports multipart scanning, private history, themes, and image export. See [mobile import](docs/mobile-import.en.md).
