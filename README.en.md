Codex Work Receipt summarizes turns, tool calls, Tokens, duration, and models. It also reports cache hit rate, per-turn efficiency, P50 / P90 latency, a work-time heatmap, and model/tool structure, then turns the result into playful AI work points, a job title, and a review. Receipts never include prompts, responses, source code, project paths, file names, tool arguments, or tool output.

The cwr2 protocol creates stable privacy-safe facts for each session and calendar day, allowing overlapping today, last-seven-days, and this-week receipts to be deduplicated. Every receipt also produces one `.cwr.json` WeChat import file. Scan import appears only when the complete payload fits in one data QR code.

## Quickstart

Requires Node.js 20+ and local Codex session records. No clone is required. The first interactive run asks whether to save automatically or use manual-only mode. Manual mode can generate by time range, a selected session, or a selected project:

```bash
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --lang en
```

Summarize all Codex activity from today:

```bash
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --today --lang en
```

Summarize the last 3 hours:

```bash
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --hours 3 --lang en
```

“Last N hours” is a rolling summary for private history only. It does not participate in AI Work Cooperative deduplicated accounting. Use today, this week, the last seven days, a specific session, or custom whole calendar dates when you want accountable canonical facts.

Interactively choose a session, project, or custom range:

```bash
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --select-session --lang en
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --select-project --lang en
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --custom-range --lang en
```

Advanced use can pass `--project <directory>`, `--from <start>`, and `--to <end>` directly. Whole calendar-date ranges produce cwr2 canonical facts; exact date-time ranges are private cwr1 summaries.

HTML, structured data, and the WeChat import file are written to `./codex-work-receipt-output/` by default. The page can download its `.cwr.json` file and save a high-resolution PNG containing only the full receipt and WeChat mini-program code. “More receipt features” provides 15 copyable commands organized into tabs for time ranges, sessions and projects, automation, and Ticket Buddy extensions. The web controls stay out of the exported image. See the [CLI guide](docs/cli.en.md).

## Automatic saving or manual only

Automatic saving uses the Codex `Stop` hook. Whenever a Codex turn stops, it quietly refreshes the same daily HTML, full JSON, and `.cwr.json` WeChat import file on this computer. It does not open a browser, upload files, or run a persistent watcher. The automatic path is file-first and does not generate a data QR.

Choose the mode again:

```bash
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --setup --lang en
```

Or enable, disable, and inspect automatic saving directly:

```bash
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --enable-auto --lang en
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --disable-auto --lang en
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --auto-status --lang en
```

Automatic receipts live under `~/.codex-work-receipt/auto/YYYY-MM-DD/`. Switching to manual-only mode removes only the AI Work Receipt hook; it keeps existing receipts and unrelated Codex hooks. Restart Codex after installing the hook. If Codex asks you to review it, use `/hooks` to inspect and trust it. See the official [Codex hooks documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks).

## Ask Codex directly

Install the AI Work Receipt skill and Ticket Buddy Codex pet together:

```bash
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --install-companion --lang en
```

Restart Codex, open `Settings > Pets`, select Refresh, choose “票仔 · AI 小票工” (Ticket Buddy), and use `/pet` to wake it. Then ask:

> Ticket Buddy, create today's receipt.

> Ticket Buddy, create a receipt for the last three hours.

To install only the skill:

```bash
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --install-skill --lang en
```

Then ask Codex:

> Create an AI work receipt for my latest Codex session.

Codex will choose the range and theme, run the CLI, and open the receipt. See the [Codex Skill guide](docs/codex-skill.en.md).

## Desktop to mobile

The desktop page generates one privacy-safe `.cwr.json` file. Send it to WeChat File Transfer, then choose “Import from chat file” in the companion mini program. A single data QR remains available only for receipts that fit completely in one code. See [mobile import](docs/mobile-import.en.md).
