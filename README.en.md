The tool reads timestamps and numerical metadata from local Codex sessions. Generated receipts do not contain prompts, responses, source code, project paths, or file names.

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 20+ and local Codex session records.

```bash
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --latest --lang en
```

Summarize all Codex activity from today in your local timezone:

```bash
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --today --lang en
```

Outputs are written to `./codex-work-receipt-output/` by default.

## Desktop-to-mobile flow

```text
Local Codex sessions
  → run one command
  → generate an HTML receipt and data QR code
  → scan from the companion mini program
  → change themes, save, and share
```

The companion mini program supports QR import, local history, themes, and image export. Scan the official mini-program code with WeChat, then scan the adjacent data QR code to import the current receipt.

## Ask Codex directly

Install the AI Work Receipt skill once:

```bash
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --install-skill --lang en
```

Then ask Codex naturally:

> Create an AI work receipt for my latest Codex session.

> Generate today's AI work receipt with the diner theme.

Codex will select the correct mode and theme, run the CLI, and open the generated page. You can also invoke `$ai-work-receipt` explicitly.

The skill is installed at `~/.agents/skills/ai-work-receipt/` and does not modify the current repository. Restart Codex if the current session does not detect it.

## Features

- Latest-session and today summaries
- Complete Chinese and English receipt copy
- Three visual receipt themes
- Turns, user messages, tool calls, interruptions, Tokens, duration, and models
- Playful AI work points, job titles, and reviews
- Versioned `cwr1` QR payload for mobile import
- Local JSON snapshots and deduplicated history
- Installable Codex skill for natural-language generation
- No prompt, response, code, path, or file-name export

## Common options

```bash
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --latest --lang en --theme diner
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --latest --lang en --no-open
npx codex-work-receipt@latest --today --lang en --timezone Asia/Shanghai --output ./my-receipt.html
```

Run `npx codex-work-receipt@latest --help` for the full option list.

## Privacy

- Reads `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl` by default
- Extracts event types, timestamps, model names, and numerical statistics only
- Does not store prompts, responses, source code, project paths, or file names
- Does not send session data over the network while running
- Saves HTML and structured history locally

See [docs/privacy.md](docs/privacy.md) and [docs/data-schema.md](docs/data-schema.md).

## Open-source boundary

This repository contains the desktop CLI, receipt renderer, QR data protocol, tests, and documentation. It does not contain the companion mini-program source code or server implementation.

## Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a-bai-2026/ai-work-receipt.git
cd codex-work-receipt
npm install
npm test
npm run receipt -- --latest
```

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before contributing. Never submit real Codex sessions.
