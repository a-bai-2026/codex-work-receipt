name: ai-work-receipt
description: Generate and open a privacy-first local AI work receipt from Codex session metadata. Use when the user asks Codex to create, regenerate, open, or locate an “AI 打工小票” or “AI work receipt” for the latest session or today, in Chinese or English, including requests for the classic, diner, or payroll theme. Do not use for real invoices, salary calculations, API billing, or non-Codex activity.

# AI 打工小票

Use the published `codex-work-receipt` CLI as the only statistics and rendering engine. Execute the command for the user instead of merely describing it. Do not reimplement or inspect Codex session parsing yourself.

## Interpret the request

- Use `--latest` for “刚刚”“这次”“最近一次”“上一段工作” or an unspecified request for one receipt.
- Use `--today` for “今天”“今日”“今天全部工作” or a daily summary.
- Use `--theme classic` for “经典白票” or no specified theme.
- Use `--theme diner` for “复古粉票”“粉色小票” or “diner”.
- Use `--theme payroll` for “夜班绿票”“绿色小票” or “payroll”.
- Add `--no-open` only when the user asks not to open the browser.
- Add `--timezone <IANA name>` only when the user explicitly requests another timezone.
- Use `--lang en` when the user requests English or asks for the receipt in English. Use `--lang zh-CN` otherwise.
- If the user asks for an unsupported date range, explain that the current version supports only the latest session or today. Do not invent flags.

## Execute

1. Check `node --version`. Require Node.js 20 or newer. If it is missing or older, report the requirement and stop.
2. Run from the user's current working directory:

```bash
npx --yes codex-work-receipt@latest --latest --lang zh-CN --theme classic
```

Replace only the mode and optional flags according to the request.

3. Let the CLI open the generated HTML unless the user requested `--no-open`.
4. On success, report the HTML path and tell the user to scan the official mini-program code first, then the adjacent data QR code.

## Privacy and failures

- Do not read, quote, summarize, or expose prompt text, response text, code, project paths, or file names from Codex sessions.
- Do not upload session data or add custom mini-program codes. The CLI reads numerical metadata locally and uses the fixed official mini-program code.
- If `npx` needs network permission to fetch the package, request the narrow permission needed to run it.
- If no Codex session is found, report that the user must complete at least one Codex task locally before generating a receipt.
- If generation fails, return the CLI error concisely and do not claim that a receipt was created.
